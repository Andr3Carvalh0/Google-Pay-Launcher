# Google Pay Launcher

A small Android application that launches the Google Pay app.

### Why?
So I can have a custom icon on my phones lockscreen ðŸ˜„. Thats all.

### Other notices
Somethings won't make much sense (like... why did I create so many classes when I could just have a if statement in the activity).
I can assure you (or at least I hope ðŸ˜„) those were done on purpose, so I could explore some Android apis.
